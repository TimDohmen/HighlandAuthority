                <p class="mt-2">The highland games are events held throughout the year in Scotland and other countries as a way of
                  celebrating Scottish and Celtic culture. They are often in conjunction with festivals and full of rich
                  traditions. In their original form many centuries ago, Highland games revolved around athletic and
                  sports competitions.</p>
                <p>The first historical references to the Heavy Events were during the reign of King Malcolm III
                  (1057-1093). The Ceres Games of Fife, Scotland, are considered the oldest, continuous Highland Games,
                  beginning in 1314. The English Government, during the Act of Proscription years (1746-82), however,
                  outlawed all Highland Games, including the Ceres Games. The Act banned all Scottish culture, including
                  the wearing of kilts and the playing of bagpipes! The Ceres Games also were not held during World War
                  I and World War II.</p>
                <p>Highland Games have been picked up across continents with the first Highland Games in the USA
                  happening in New York in 1836. The Caledonian Club of San Francisco held its first Games in 1866 and
                  boasts the oldest continuously running Games in the USA with the St Andrews Society of Detroit as a
                  close second.</p>

                <p class="mt-2">The Weight for Distance event consists of a weight made of metal and consist of a spherical or box
                  weight with a chain and handle attached. The handle may be a ring, triangle, or a "D" shape. The
                  implement shall not measure more than 18 inches in overall length from the bottom of the weight to the
                  top of the handle. The official weight of each implement is the total weight, including the handle.
                  The
                  competitor may use either hand to throw the weight, but only one hand may be used. Any style may be
                  used
                  to throw the weight as long as it is deemed safe by the judge. The competitor may start and stop the
                  throw provided that no part of the implement has made contact with the ground or the trig board during
                  the aborted attempt. If the implement has made contact with the ground or the trig board after the
                  attempt was initiated and prior to receiving permission from the judge, then the attempt will be a
                  foul.

                <p class="mt-2">This event is similar to the hammer throw as seen in modern-day track and field competitions, though
                  with some differences. In the Scottish event, a round metal ball weighing 16 lb (kg) for light and 22
                  lb
                  (kg) for heavy for the men classes. Women throw a 12 lb (kg) light hammer and 16 lb (kg) heavy hammer.
                  The hammer weight is attached to the end of a shaft about 4 feet in length and made out of wood,
                  bamboo,
                  rattan, or plastic. The athlete will have thier back to the field. With the feet in a fixed position,
                  the hammer is whirled about one’s head and thrown for distance over the shoulder. Hammer throwers
                  sometimes employ specially designed footwear with flat blades to dig into the turf to maintain their
                  balance and resist the centrifugal forces of the implement as it is whirled about the head. This
                  substantially increases the distance attainable in the throw.

                <p class="mt-2">The Caber Toss is the signature event of the Highland Games. A Caber (gaelic for "Tree") is a tree
                  that
                  has been cut and trimmed down so one end is slightly wider than the other. It can vary length from 12
                  to
                  22 feet and between 50 and 180 pounds. The objective of this event is for the athlete to flip a "12
                  o’clock” (which is considered a perfect toss) meaning that the athlete will "pick" the caber (the act
                  of
                  leaning down and popping the caber up into their hands), run with the caber and then attempt to flip
                  it
                  end over end so that it lands perfectly straight in front of them or pointing to 12 o'clock on an
                  imaginary clock face on the ground. Points are awarded from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock, and even if the
                  athlete does not flip the caber they are awarded points for how far it goes over before it falls back
                  in
                  degrees.

                <p class="mt-2">There are six different grades in bagpiping: V - I (five through one are amateur grades) plus
                  "Professional" which is sometimes called "Open." ("Open" competions are open to any grade level of
                  competitor, though lackluster pipers are not expected to subject the judges to a poor standard of
                  play.) Some associations also break grades further into "Juvenile" and "Adult" or "Junior" and
                  "Senior." Below is a loose description of the grades, though you can expect different opinions since
                  there is no written standard. One piping judge with 40 years of piping experience described any
                  attempt to define grades as "impossible." (A certain amount of piping appreciation is subjective and
                  therefore a set standard would be hard for judges to implement.) These are descriptions of a typical
                  player in the grade, not necessarily the
                  ones winning that may belong in a higher grade.</p>

                <p>
                  Grade V (five): This is the lowest grade (sometimes not recognized or offered) and is the rank
                  beginner level. At this grade, in some associations (such as WUSPBA), performers are merely
                  competing using a practice chanter. In other associations (such as EUSPBA), performers can be on a
                  full set of pipes. Grade V pipers may or may not be required to belong to their association to
                  compete as these events may or may not be sanctioned. Competitors typically try to get through the
                  tune without any glaring errors. Tunes are played very slowly. Many pipers skip any "chanter only"
                  grade.</p>

                <p>
                  Grade IV (four): Pipers are playing on a full set of pipes. At any given time, about 60%-70% of
                  competing pipers that you run into are going to be in this grade (or in Grade V). Slow tunes are
                  played, and quick tunes are played at a reduced tempo. Competitors may not be able to tune their own
                  drones perfectly. Only partial piobaireachd tunes are played in competition. Occasional minor
                  embellishment mistakes. Competitors who don't make technical errors, but don't have particularly
                  good expression might win. Drones not always steady throughout the tune. An attempt at musicality
                  and expression is made and sometimes achieved. Most associations don't offer MSRs (March,
                  Strathspey, Reel) at this level.</p>

                <p>
                  Grade III (three): Competitors can tune their own drones pretty accurately. Complete piobaireachd
                  tunes are played in competition. Good execution of fingering. MSRs, sometimes only SRs, are played
                  slowly at this grade. Only about 25%-30% of pipers ever advance to this grade. Drones are steady.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Grade II (two): Command of many tunes, judges can select from several submitted. Drones are steady
                  and tuned very well, if not perfect. MSRs just about at tempo. Very good embellishments, musicality
                  and expression.</p>

                  Grade I (one): Excellent playing, everything just about perfect. Performance is just shy of
                  professional quality.</p>

                <p>
                  Professional: All aspects of performance are consistently outstanding: drones stay steady and tuned
                  for long periods of playing, lovely expression, crisp and clear embellishments, very fast tempo on
                  demand.</p>

                <p class="mt-2">Irish dance or Irish dancing is a group of traditional dance forms originating from Ireland,
                  encompassing dancing both
                  solo and in groups, and dancing for social, competitive, and performance purposes. Irish dance in its
                  current form
                  developed from various influences such as French quadrilles and English country dancing throughout the
                  18th and 19th
                  centuries. Dance was taught by "travelling dance masters" across Ireland throughout this period, and
                  separate dance
                  forms developed according to regional practice and differing purposes. Irish dance became a
                  significant part of Irish
                  culture, particularly for Irish nationalist movements. From the early 20th century, a number of
                  organisations promoted
                  and codified the various forms of dance, creating competitive structures and standardised styles.</p>

                <p>Solo Irish dance includes the most well-known form of Irish dance, Irish stepdance, which was
                  popularised from 1994
                  onwards by dance shows such as Riverdance, and which is practised competitively across the Irish
                  diaspora. Stepdance is
                  characterised by the rigid upper body and intricate footwork of its performers. Other forms of solo
                  Irish dance include
                  sean-nós dance, a relaxed and social dance style involving improvised steps, and festival Irish dance,
                  a style which
                  separated from step dance in the mid-20th century.</p>

                <p>Irish dancing in groups is made up of a number of styles and traditions, which developed from French
                  and English dances
                  and formations. Ceili dance, practised both competitively and socially, is performed by groups of two
                  to sixteen people,
                  and often uses traditional or codified dances and formations. Its footwork is simple, and emphasis is
                  placed on the
                  figures and formations of the dances. Set dance is primarily a social tradition, for groups of four
                  dancers, and
                  includes elements of the intricate footwork found in step dance.
